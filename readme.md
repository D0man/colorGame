# Color Game

Simple game where you need to click on the right color to get points. Every time you click text - color will randomly change. There are three dificulty levels with 3, 6 and 9 answers. You have 50 seconds to gain score, good answers will increase it's value, bad answers will decrease. 

## Rules:
Look at the color of the word at the top of the screen, then click on the word that applies to that color.

## Why this project?
I did it to better understand how the events between components work in React and try to change them with diffrent methods. I was thinking that making a game could be fun, but it got me a little confused when i was testing it out, so next time i will try to avoid tricky games.
